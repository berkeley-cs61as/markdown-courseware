## 9. square limit

Make changes to the square limit of wave shown in the figure below by working
at each of the levels described above. In particular:

a. Add some segments to the primitive `wave` painter of exercise 6, Primitive
Painters (to add a smile, for example).

b. Change the pattern constructed by `corner-split` (for example, by using
only one copy of the `up-split` and `right-split` images instead of two).

c. Modify the version of `square-limit` that uses `square-of-four` so as to
assemble the corners in a different pattern. (For example, you might make the
big Mr. Rogers look outward from each corner of the square.)
