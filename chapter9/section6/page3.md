Notes:

_y_ = (1/2)(_y_ + _x_/_y_) is a simple transformation of the equation _y_ =
_x_/_y_; to derive it, add _y_ to both sides of the equation and divide by 2.

You may have noticed that we have effectively derived Newton's method for
calculating square roots. But... there are so many other ways! If you're
intersted, here's a cool link:
