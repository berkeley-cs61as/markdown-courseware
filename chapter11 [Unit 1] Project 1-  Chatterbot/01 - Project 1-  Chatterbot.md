We have a new Project 1 for this semester called "Chatterbot".

A "Chatterbot" is a program that is able to "chat" or "communicate" with a
user, simulating a conversation. We are going to implement some simple
chatterbots in this project using concepts that you learned.

To get the skeleton code for this project, type in the terminal

    
    
    	cp -r ~cs61as/lib/chatterbot/ .
    	

You should then have a directory called "chatterbot" with 4 files inside them.

  * **readme.txt** contains instructions and questions for this project
  * **chatterbot.scm** is the main file you will be modifying
  * **grader.scm** is an autograder for this project. Note that it is not comprehensive. Adding questions will be part of your grade
  * **adjectives.scm** contains a list of adjectives. You don't need to modify this file

This is an individual project. You can bounce ideas with your classmate, but
sharing or copying your classmate's code (or ones you find online) will be
considered cheating. Before you submit, make sure that your file loads without
any error. Submissions that do not load properly will receive an automatic 0.

If you have any questions, please ask on Piazza, OH or lab.
