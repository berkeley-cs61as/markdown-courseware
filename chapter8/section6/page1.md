## Takeaways

Some take-aways from this subsection:

  * The Substitution Model helps us in understanding how application works, but it is NOT how the interpreter does application.
  * Evaluating the arguments before applying (i.e. Applicative Order) is one method of evaluating. There are other methods of evaluation (i.e. Normal Order) where you only evaluate the arguments when you need the value
