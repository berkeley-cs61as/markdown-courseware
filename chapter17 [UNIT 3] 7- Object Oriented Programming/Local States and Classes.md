## Takeaways

Several takeaways from this subsection:

  * In OOP, we work with objects: smart data that know what values they have and what functions they can do.
  * Objects have states: knowledge on what has happened to them in the past.
  * Every object is a part of a certain class.
  * A class can have many methods. The order in which they are defined doesn't matter.

## what's next?

Can a class inherit from another class? We will see in the next subsection.
