## Notes on working together

Here are some suggestions to share your work with your partner:

  * [gitHub](https://github.com/). Solid, but long set-up time. [Try here](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) for a taste
  * DropBox. Easy to set-up. Be careful with overwriting your partner's file
  * GoogleDocs. Easy to set-up. Less likely to overwrite code
  * E-Mail! Nominate one person. Send all of your code to him/her and he/she will be the one responsible for merging them together
