Here is a template for your homework to make it easier for our autograders to
grade your work. Remember to comment anything that isn't code with a semicolon
`;.`

``;; Exercise 1.

;; Write an iterative exponentiation process that takes a logarithmic number
of steps.

;; YOUR CODE HERE

  
  
;; Exercise 2.

;; Compute the golden ratio

;; YOUR CODE HERE

  
  
;; Exercise 3.

;; Write cont-frac recursively and iteratively, and use it to estimate e.

;; YOUR CODE HERE

  
  
;; Exercise 4.

;; Write next-perf and use it to find the third perfect number.

;; YOUR CODE HERE

  
;; This should output #f

(type-check sqrt number? 'hello)

  
;; This should output 2

(type-check sqrt number? 4)

  
  
;; Exercise 5.

;; Explain what happens when interchanging the base cases in the cc procedure.

;; YOUR CODE HERE

  
  
;; Exercise 6.

;; Give the invariant relating the values of the parameters in xpt and exp-
iter.

;; YOUR CODE HERE
