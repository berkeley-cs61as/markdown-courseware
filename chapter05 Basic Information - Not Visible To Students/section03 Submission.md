## Submitting Assignments

Submitting your assignments is very easy.

  1. Go into the directory containing your homework
  2. Type ` submit [hw#]`
  3. Type no for every file that isn't your hw file
  4. Type yes and submit the template (or file if there is no template) that you modified for the homework

Submitting projects is a similar process.

## Solutions

if you have submitted a homework assignment, you can see the solution by going
to the terminal and typing `solution hw[#]` where # is the hw number (e.g.
"solution hw0-2", "solution hw1") This is extremely useful for review before
quiz."

*if you look at the solution for a hw, you can't resubmit that particular hw. 

*If you are working on the lab machines, you have to ssh into star before following the instruction above for solutions. You can do this by going to the terminal and type "ssh star". It will ask you for your password again. 

## An Example

    
    
    star [528] ~ # cd hw1
    star [529] ~/hw1 # submit hw1
    Looking for files to turn in....
    Turn in ./hw1.scm?  [yes/no] y
    The files you have submitted are:
            ./hw1.scm
    Is this correct? [yes/no] y
    Copying submission of assignment hw1....
    Submission complete.
