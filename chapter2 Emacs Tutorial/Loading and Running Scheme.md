## Extra

You don't always need/want to load the full file. Sometimes, you might just
have changed one expression!

C-x C-e lets you evaluate a single expression, with the result printed into
the interpreter.

Move the cursor right after the last parenthesis of the expression. Then...
C-x C-e and presto, the result shows up in the interpreter!
