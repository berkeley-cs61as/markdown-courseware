## Takeaways

Several takeaways from this subsection:

  * Some classes will be a more 'specialized' or 'specific' version of another class. In these cases, we want to make the specific class a 'child' of the 'parent' class.
  * A child class inherits all methods of the parent class.
  * Keep track of what variable is actually in scope in your class.
