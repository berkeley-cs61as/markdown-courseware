## Instance vs Instantiation variables

Instantiation variables are also instance variables; that is, every instance
has its own private value for them. The only diff erence is in the notation
and when you set the initial value. For instantiation variables you give a
value when you call instantiate, but for other instance variables you give the
value in the class de finition.
