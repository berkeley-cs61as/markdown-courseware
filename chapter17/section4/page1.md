## Takeaways

There are three kinds of local state variables: instantiation, instance, and
class.

  * An instantiation variable is specified when you create an object using `instantiate`.
  * An instance variable is a variable that each object has and is independent from each other; changing the value of one doesn't affect the others.
  * A class variable is a variable that is shared with all objects of that class; change the value of a class variable and every object of that class will notice the change.
