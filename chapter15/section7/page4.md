## Unbalanced Tree

![](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/ch2-Z-G-52.gif)

The image above is the result of adding the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 in
order to an empty tree. (Make sure you try this out with pen and paper to see
that this is the case). We say that this tree is **unbalanced** because one
side of the tree has way more elements than the other.
