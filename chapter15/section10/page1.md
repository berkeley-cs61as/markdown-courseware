## Exercise 9.

Read [section 2.3.4](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-
text/book/book-Z-H-16.html#%25_sec_2.3.4) and do exercises 2.67 - 2.72.

## Exercise 10.

Programming by example: In some programming systems, instead of writing an
algorithm, you give examples of how you'd like the program to behave, and the
language figures out the algorithm itself:

`> (define pairup (regroup '((1 2) (3 4) ...)))`

` > (pairup '(the rain in spain stays mainly on the plain))`

` ((the rain) (in spain) (stays mainly) (on the))`

Write `regroup`. Read `~cs61as/lib/regroup.problem` for details.
