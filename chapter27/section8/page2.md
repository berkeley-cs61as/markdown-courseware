### Do You Want to be the Very Best?

You have access to a stream of all 744 pokemon data
[here](/static/pokemon_data) and "~cs61as/lib/mapreduce/pokemon_data".
`streammapreduce.scm` should load it automatically and define the variable
"data" as your input. The key is the pokemon national number, the value is a
list of regional number, name, name (yes it appears twice), and the rest are
types that they have. For example the first element is `(1 1 bulbasaur
bulbasaur grass poison)` so it has the national number 1, regional number of
1, names bulbasaur, and has the types 'grass' and 'poison'. A Pokemon can
either have 1 or 2 types. Here is an example of one that only has one type:
`(4 4 charmander charmander fire)`. You can take a look at the input by typing
`(ss data)` in the interpreter after loading the files.

Define the mapper, reducer and base-case such that calling mapreduce with
`(mapreduce mapper reducer base-case data)` would return a list of key-value
pairs where the keys are different types, and the values represent how many
times a pokemon of that type appears in the dataset. The final result should
yield the following (in any order):

    
    
    ((grass . 86) (dragon . 39) (normal . 99) (flying . 93) (poison . 59) (ice . 35) (fire . 58) (ghost . 37) (psychic . 77) (electric . 47) (water . 124) (fairy . 35) (bug . 70) (steel . 42) (ground . 62) (rock . 54) (fighting . 45) (dark . 44))
