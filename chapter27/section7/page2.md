### Most Frequent Word

Let's write another mapreduce function (We're not chaining yet). This time,
our input has a key of 'words' and the value are numbers, representing how
many times they appeared in a document. We want our output to be a list of a
**single** key-value pair where just like the input, our key is a word and our
value is a number such that it is the highest number encountered.

Note: our solution isn't ideal, and it's a little contrived. It doesn't take
advantage of the parallelism that mapreduce offers.

    
    >(define x (list (make-kv-pair her 1) (make-kv-pair i 4) (make-kv-pair saw 1))
    >(most-frequent x) ; i appears the most
    ((i . 4))
