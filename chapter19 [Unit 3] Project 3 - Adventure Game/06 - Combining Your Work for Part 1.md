## Combining Work

You've finished part 1 of the project! At this point, you should have finished
Questions 1, 2, A3-A5, and B3-B5. Now is the time to combine these answers
into one file! Make sure everything still works after merging.

## Testing

Make sure you make a transcript that shows us your project works! To be
complete, it should adequately test all of your modifications, for both
partners. If you can't get something to work, include it in the transcript as
well. We like seeing well-tested programs :)
