We also introduce `scheme1.scm`! Scheme-1 is a simple Scheme interpreter
written in Scheme. While it cannot do all the things STk can do, it does
demonstrate the working parts you need in an interpreter, such as evaluating
expressions `(eval-1)` and applying procedures to arguments `(apply-1)`.
`eval-1` takes a compound expression and reduces it to its simplest value.
`apply-1` takes a procedure and some simple values and applies the procedure
to those values to get a result.
