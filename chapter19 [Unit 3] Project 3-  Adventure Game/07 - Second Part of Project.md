## You're Half-Way There!

Remember, at this point you should have finished up until exercise 5. Also,
make sure you and your partner have combined your work!

The second part of the project includes three exercises for each person, but
**you have to read each other's code midway**, because one partner's exercises
7 and 8 build on the other partner's exercise 6. Finally, exercise 9 requires
the two partners' work to be combined. You will have to create a version of
`adv.scm` that has both partners' changes. This may take some thinking! If
both parners modify the same method in the same object class, you'll have to
write a version of the method that incorporates both modifications.
