## testing

You now finished implementing the painters! Let's test your code. To test it,
type on Scheme:

    
    > (cs)
    > (ht)
    > (===your-painter=== full-frame)
    
    For example:
    > (wave full-frame)
    > ((square-limit wave 3) full-frame)
      
    (note that you cannot actually draw on js-scheme. If you are using ssh, make sure to have the -X option turned on)
