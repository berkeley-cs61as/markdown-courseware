<p>Welcome to CS 61AS, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)!</p>

<p>Since this course is relatively new, there will be occasional updates to the following information so as to optimize your experience as students.</p>

<h2>Discussions and Labs</h2>
<p>Lab is held every Monday through Thursday in 330 Soda. Discussions will be held on Mondays and Thursdays. The discussion schedule that your unit track follows is linked in the Calendar on the homepage. <strong>In order to receive attendance points during times when your discussion is being held, you must either be in lab or at your discussion.</strong>
<p>Discussions will be one hour long, which is a third of a lab section. If, during your discussion time, you are neither at discussion or in lab, you will NOT get attendance points.</p>
<p>You are free to attend discussions of different unit track than yours if you wish.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>Attendance</h2>
<p>You are expected to attend every class meeting. Attendance will be graded. <strong>You will receive&nbsp;0.5&nbsp;points for every hour&nbsp;of lab you attend.</strong> (e.g., 2 hr of lab on Monday = 1 hr of lab on Monday and 1 hr of lab on Friday = 1 hr of lab and 1 hr of discussion on Wednesday = 1 attendance point.) You must be working on 61AS material during this time, and there should be a TA or lab assistant present at all times. You will also get points for attending discussions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can get up to</p>
<p>[max points] = 2 * min(14, [number of lessons])</p> 
<p>attendance points.</p>
<p>If you finish the course early, you should talk to your TA, and you will&nbsp;receive:</p>
<p>[max points] * [number weeks left] / 14</p> 
<p>extra attendance points</p>
<p>For example, if Louis Reasoner is taking units 1-3, then [number of lessons] = 10, so [maxpoints] = 2 * 10 = 20, i.e. Louis can get at most 20 attendance points.</p>
<p>Assuming Louis doesn't finish early, he would have to attend at least 2*20 = 40 hours of lab to get full credit.</p>

<h2>Units and Lessons</h2>
<p>The course is organized into five&nbsp;"units" numbered 0 through 4. Unit 0 is the introductory material for students whose prior experience does not include programming recursive functions, and helps ease students into the heavier material in the following units. <strong>We will not be offering Unit 0 over the summer</strong>, since students taking CS 61AS over the summer should expect to work through this course at a fast pace. Units 1 through 4 correspond to chapters of the SICP textbook. This is a variable credit course - you earn one UCB credit unit for each course Unit 1 through 4 that you complete successfully. For example,&nbsp;if you wish to work at a slower pace, you can take the first two units, Unit 1 and 2, and receive 2 UCB credit units. You may then finish the course next semester.

<p>We offer three different unit tracks this summer:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Unit Track 1-2: </strong>This is the minimum number of units you can take. If you prefer working at a slower pace, take this unit track. You may finish Units 3 and 4 in a following semester.</li>
	<li><strong>Unit Track 1-3: </strong>Since Unit 3 covers object-oriented programming, completing Units 1-3 will allow you to take CS 61B next semester. You will still need to complete Unit 4 in order to fulfill the CS 61A requirement.</li>
	<li><strong>Unit Track 1-4: </strong>Completing all four core units fulfills the CS 61A requirement for majors. <strong>We STRONGLY advise against taking all four units over the summer.</strong> Seeing as taking this unit track during the school year is already strenuous, completing it over the summer equates to learning the same material at TWICE the speed. You MUST speak to the TA first before deciding on this unit track.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It is very important that you sign up for the correct units on Tele-bears.</strong> We will go over in class the important deadlines and how to sign up for the correct number of units.</p>
<p>The online material is organized in terms of "lessons"; each lesson contains in-class lab activities and homework, mostly taken from the textbook, for you to do on your own. After you submit each homework assignment, you can see our solutions to the lesson's problems; you should be sure to read these and compare our solutions to yours to ensure that you understand the concepts of the lesson.</p>
<p>Each lesson begins with links to the reading for that lesson. Do the reading before you do the lesson! In addition to the textbook, you should read Brian's lecture notes, also online. A good learning&nbsp;method for a lesson is to read&nbsp;the lecture notes, then go through the lesson, then read SICP. SICP is an awesome book, but it can be a little dense. Each lesson in units 1-4 also includes videos from a previous semester of the lecture-based 61A. These are completely optional and you should NOT watch them in class, but feel free to watch them in your own time for extra practice.</p>
<p>Homework will be graded based on effort rather than correctness. This being said, <b>any homework or project that does not load into the stk interpreter will receive NO credit.</b>&nbsp;This is to make sure that you always test your code by loading the file into your scheme interpreter.</p>
<p>Some&nbsp;of the homeworks include problems labelled as "Extra for Experts" or "Challenge Problems". These problems are entirely optional; do them only if you have finished the regular assignment and want to do something more challenging. There is no extra credit for these problems.</p>

<h2>Quizzes</h2>
<p>After completing each lesson and reading the online solutions, you will take an online quiz on the material you learned in that lesson.&nbsp;The link to the quiz system is in the navigation bar at the top of this page, and also on the Resources page, under Course Material Resources. Or, you can click <a href="http://www.cs61as-quizzes.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. <strong>**NOTE: Quizzes for lesson 4, 8, and 9 are still paper quizzes. Ask the TA to take those quizzes.**</strong></p>
<p>Our quiz system is still rather new and can have bugs, typos, etc. Please be patient with it, and give us feedback when you can!</p>
<p>Each quiz is worth 10 points, and will be graded and returned to you by the next lab section. <strong>You have one retake per quiz, where the retake will consist of entirely different questions. Your grade for the retake will be capped at 9 points. We will use your retake grade even if you scored higher in the first one</strong>. If you don't pass a quiz the second time, email your TA so they can help you get back on track. The quizzes are closed book, and you are allowed<strong>&nbsp;one double-sided cheat sheet for each quiz.</strong></p>

<h2>Course Credits and Grading</h2>
<p>Grading is done using a point system. Each unit has approximately 70 points. Here are the point distributions for assignments and exams:</p>
<p><strong>Homework:</strong> 2 points each<br /><strong><strong>Attendance:</strong>&nbsp; </strong><strong>[max points] = 2 * min(14, [number of lessons])<br /><strong></strong>Quizzes: </strong>10 points each<br /><strong>Project 1:</strong> 15 points<br /><strong>Project 2:</strong> 15 points<br /><strong>Project 3:</strong> 25 points<br /><strong>Final Exam:</strong> ~10 points per unit</p>
<p>If you have a complaint regarding grades, please email both your&nbsp;TA and your&nbsp;reader.</p>
<p>To determine your grade, we add up the points scored on the units that you completed divided by the maximum possible for those units. The letter grade is based on that fraction:</p>
<p>A+ 94-100% A 92-93% A&minus; 90-91%</p>
<p>B+ 84-89% B 79-83% B&minus; 74-78%</p>
<p>C+ 71-73% C 69-70% C&minus; 67-68%</p>
<p>D+ 63-66% D 60-62% D&minus; 57-59%</p>
<p>The range of scores within the B range is deliberately larger than the range for other grades; the expectation is that the average grade will be somewhere in the B range.</p>
<h2>Deadlines</h2>
<p><strong>We've established deadlines for completing each unit <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/spreadsheets/d/12ngYcqau1KzrQxbEBwQtc7qtUrYGcLOs7_vDJkuRYSI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. You can also find them on the calendar on the homepage. </strong>You are fully responsible for keeping track of your own deadlines.</p>
<p>Notice there are soft deadlines for each Lesson and a separate hard deadline for each Unit. The Lesson deadlines are for homeworks. You start the semester with 6 slip days that you may use at any time to get an &ldquo;extension&rdquo; on an assignment. Once you use up all of your slip days, any late homeworks will receive no credit. <strong>However, if you get back on track with the deadlines, you get all of your slip days back.</strong> Getting back on track entails meeting the homework deadline for a particular assignment and passing all tests for the autograder for that particular assignment.</p>
<p>The hard deadlines dictate quiz deadlines for all Lessons in that Unit (including retakes) and the corresponding project. You cannot use slip days for quizzes or projects. <strong>For projects only, late submissions will be penalized based on how late they are.</strong> Projects that are one day late will lose 5% of the earned grade. Projects that are 2-3 days late will lose 25% of the earned grade. Projects that are 3-7 days late will lose 50% of the earned grade. Projects that are more than 7 days late will receive no credit.</p>

<h2>Staff and Other Human Resources</h2>
<p>The official instructor of this course is Professor Hilfinger. The TA for this class is Judy Wang, and the reader is Caryn Tran.</p>
<p>Another resource for class-related questions is our online discussion group <a href="https://piazza.com/class/iacyr264xcuic" target="_blank">Piazza</a>, where you can get answers from other students and from the course staff. Do NOT post individual administrative questions ("Why did I get 5 points...") on the discussion group. We will be posting many important updates on Piazza, and you will be responsible for keeping up with the information that we post there.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>
<p>If you wish to work from a home computer, please follow the setup guides located on the Resources page.</p>
<p>Once you've downloaded the software, be sure that you run the application called "stk-simply" rather than just "stk." (The lab computers are set up so that stk does the right thing, but your home computer isn't.)</p>

<h2>Textbook(s)</h2>
<p>The SICP textbook, by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman, is available online (free) <a title="SICP" href="http://www.mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html" target="_blank">here</a>. It is the best computer science book ever written! The writing is terse; each sentence repays careful reading.</p>
<p>Those students whose prior experience does not include programming recursive functions, or does not include the Scheme language, or does not include computer programming at all, will start with excerpts from Simply Scheme, by Brian Harvey and Matthew Wright, a book written specifically as a "prequel" to SICP. The entire book is also available online <a title="Simply Scheme" href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>There are also some online documents that are required reading in certain lessons. These can usually be found in the intro section for each lesson. For everything you ever want to know about the course, try the "Old 61A Reader" link on the Resources page. Note: The "Reader" is taken from the course reader of the old lecture-based 61A, so some of it isn't quite right for this course. In particular, this course doesn't have midterms, but the sample midterms in the reader provide examples of the kind of questions we ask in the lesson quizzes.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Academic Honesty</h2>
<p>We believe that most students come to Berkeley because they want to learn, and therefore understand that ultimately it is you who suffer if you turn in someone else's work as your own.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is the possibility of misunderstanding, because in this class (as in most others) you are encouraged to learn from each other as well as from the course staff. That's why it's worth spelling out the rules.</p>
<p>Each lesson in this course has exercises labelled "Lab Activity" and other exercises labelled "Homework." The lab exercises are not turned in for credit. You should try each exercise on your own first, but you are encouraged to work in groups. (But bear in mind that in a self-paced course the student next to you may be working on something different from you.) Lab exercises are an introduction to the lesson's ideas, and the goal is for you to understand what they're asking by the end of the lab activity.</p>
<p>Homework assignments are expected to be completed individually. If two homework assignments are too similar, we will assume academic dishonesty and neither student will receive any credit for the assignment. You are welcome to discuss the homework with other students, but the solution you turn in must be entirely your own. <strong>To clarify, you may look over other students' lab code, but not homework. You may only share project code with your partner, for partner projects.</strong></p>
<p>For programming projects, quizzes, and the final exam, of course, it is a serious violation of academic honesty (which can get you suspended or expelled from the university) to give or accept answers to or from another student. (Exception: Some programming projects can be done in pairs. Your TA will explain this when you get to them.)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Any act of cheating in the course will receive the harshest punishment possible.</strong> The first offense results in <strong>at minimum</strong> a negative score for the assignment. If you are found to be cheating a second time, we will not hesitate to fail you, report you to the center for student conduct, and, you guessed it, call your parents.</p>
<p>We run all submitted assignments through a software plagiarism system that detects similar submissions. This will catch both copying from an online source and copying from peers. The system is <em>very good</em> at what it does. Do not assume you can outsmart it.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>To end on a happier note, here are a few final pieces of advice: this course attempts to teach a lot of the big ideas in computer science. If you ever feel like you're drowning in the material, do not hesitate to talk to a TA! 61AS is a great introductory course that will ease you into all the amazing concepts that future CS courses will cover, so remember to keep an open mind, have fun, and always respect the data abstraction!</p>
