## Takeaways

At this point, you know everything you need to draw any environment diagram,
no matter how complicated! As we go through problems in the future, don't
forget the basics! Even the most complicated pieces of code can be boiled down
into simple rules.

If there is even a single thing covered so far that you don't understand, ask
for help! Environment diagrams is one of those topics that a lot of students
find difficult.

## What's Next?

Using our new-found knowledge of the environment model of evaluation, in the
next section we're going to walk through how to implement OOP by clever-ly
using lambdas and lets.
