## What will Scheme output?

What does the Scheme interpreter output when you try the following examples?
Type each example into the interpreter to try it out. Try out every example
individually and think about the result. Some of these examples will cause
errors - you should figure out why they cause errors. (If something errors,
the interpreter will output `"*** Error:"` along with some error message.)
