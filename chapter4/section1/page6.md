## Alternatives to 61AS

**CS 61A** is the sister course to 61AS. It is offered in the traditional lecture-lab-discussion format, and covers the same Big Ideas as 61AS, except in the Python language and with a slightly different syllabus. 61A is the equivalent of Units 1-4 of 61AS. Taking either Units 1-4 of 61AS OR taking 61A will fullfil the requirements for CogSci, BioE, etc. More information:

**CS 10** is called "The Beauty and Joy of Computing". It covers the equivilent of Units 0 and 1 of 61AS and is also aims to provide a gentle intro to Computer Science. CS 10 does not fullfil any of the requirements that 61A or 61AS fullfil. It uses a graphical language called Snap! that allows you to program by dragging and dropping components together.
