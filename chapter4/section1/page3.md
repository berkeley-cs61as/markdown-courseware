## Big Ideas

In 61AS, we will explore many Big Ideas that underlie all of Computer Science.
Here are some of the big ones:

**Functions** - To start off with, we'll think of programs as functions. All programs are essentially built up of a bunch of functions. We'll start here and see what exactly is a function and what we can use them for.

**Data** - Data is another thing essential to programs. Making data the central focus of our programs leads to powerful results.

**State** - These ideas deal with the question of "How do we program assuming we can change things over time?"

**Interpreters** - We go into how an interpreter works, and end up writing our own. We'll also consider a few other interpreters and see what they all have in common.

**Programming Paradigms** - Where we blow your mind and make you program in a completely different way than you've been doing for the past 13 weeks.
