## Pacing

In terms of credit, 61AS is like no other course. Here are some of the
details.  See the syllabus for the full details.

  1. You can take 61AS over two semesters. We've divded the course into four required parts, or Units (corresponding with the units on Telebears). For example you can decide to take Units 1-3 this semester, and then Unit 4 next semester. There are also two optional units, unit 0 and unit 5, for which you can get CS 98 credit.
  2. Once you decide how many Units you're taking this semester, you follow a set of deadlines that keep you on track. There is a slipday system in place to give you a bit of extra time when you need it (see the syllabus for details.) This is useful if you have, say, 2 midterms and a paper due for other classes this week. However, if you miss too many of these deadlines, we will ask you to switch to a track with less Units. Conversely, if you're ahead of your deadlines, you may want to consider moving to a track with more Units. **You must finialize the Units you're taking by the unit change deadline.** We have incorperated deadlines into 61AS because from experience, we've determined that it's extremely miserable to finish the rest of the course in time if you don't meet them.

## Telebears

The staff  wil go over exactly what you should have on Telebears in the coming
weeks (the first three weeks of class). Don't worry about it now (the first
day). If you're worried or if something is urgent, talk with a TA.
