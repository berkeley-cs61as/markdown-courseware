## Units and Tracks

As mentioned above, the course is divided into Units:

  0. Introduction  
[optional, recommended for students with no programming experience]

  1. Functions
  2. Data
  3. State
  4. Interpreters and other Paradigms
  5. Programming Languages - Register Machines, Garbage Collection, Compilers  
[optional, recommended for students who want to be challenged even further]

Also mentioned above, you can take the course over two semesters by taking
some Units now and some Units next semester:

    
             Semester 1 | Semester 2
    ____________________|_____________
    Track 1-4  1 2 3 4  |
    Track 1-3  1 2 3    | 4
    Track 0-3  0 1 2 3  | 4
    ____________________|_____________
    Track 0-2  0 1 2    | 3 4
    Track 1-2    1 2    | 3 4
    

Tracks 0, 1, and 2 will allow you take CS 61B next semester.  However, you
must finish unit 4 in order to complete the CS 61A requirement.

**We expect everyone to start with either Track 0-3 or 1-4.**

Unit 5 is omitted from this chart. Talk with a TA if you're interested in
pursuing Unit 5.
