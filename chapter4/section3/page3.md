## running the autograder

Before submitting any homework, you should run the autograder to make sure
your solutions are correct. To run the autograder, type the following into the
terminal:

    
    grader <assignment name> <file name>

For example, to run the autograder on this homework, type the following into
the terminal:

    
     grader hw0-1 hw0-1.scm

Remember that if you pass the autograder when you submit your homework, you're
guaranteed full credit and your slip days are reset!
