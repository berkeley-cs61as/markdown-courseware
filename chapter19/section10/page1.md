## Submitting

You need to submit your modified `adv.scm, adv-world.scm `files and your
transcript. This should include solutions to Questions 1-9 **for both
partners**. Make sure you have added comments to your code highlighting all of
the changes you've made.

Also, make sure you clearly indicate at the top of adv.scm which partner is
Person A and which is Person B.

Only one person should submit. When you submit, it will prompt you for your
partner's login. (If it prompts you to put another log-in, type "." and enter)

To ensure submission went well, both partners should type

    
    glookup -t
    

into their terminal. This command gives you a list of all submitted
assignments, as well as when they were submitted.

Remember: ONLY ONE PERSON SHOULD SUBMIT!

If you need to re-submit your project for any reason, have the same person as
before submit the file. If this is not possible, send your reader an email as
a heads-up explaining the situation.
