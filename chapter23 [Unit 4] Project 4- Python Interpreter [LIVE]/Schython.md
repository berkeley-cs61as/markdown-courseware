We have a cool new project this semester that has you build a Python
interpreter in Scheme!

Get the necessary project files and the spec by running:

cp -r ~cs61as/lib/schython/ proj4/

Follow the instructions in the spec file: ` schython.text `

`Note: The directory "/schython/tests" contains some tests that you can run.
They are taken from schython.text. Instructions on how to run it can be found
under "/schython/tests/README". Your grades will be determined by how many
test cases you pass.
