## Readings

You should read [SICP 3.3.1-3](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-
text/book/book-Z-H-22.html#%_sec_3.3) to learn about mutation.

You should read [these
notes](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61as/reader/notes.pdf#page=56) on
mutation and vectors. Vectors are not covered in SICP, so pay extra attention
to the notes.
