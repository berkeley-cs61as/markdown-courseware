## Quiz Tips

Working with vectors might feel different at first, especially with all of the
new functions. We highly suggest to write notes in your cheat sheet on various
function primitives we used (e.g. make-vect, vector-ref, etc) as well as
helper procedures you are going to define in the HW exercises (e.g. vector-
append) and [these notes](http://www-
inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61as/reader/notes.pdf#61)(e.g. vector-map).
