This class is full of Big Ideas! Here are the first two:

  * The purpose of this course is **to help you learn**.
  * The staff are here to **help you succeed**.

If at any point, you feel like this isn't the case, speak up! Go to office hours, send out an email, talk to one of us in lab - whatever the method, we're here to
help.

## What Makes 61AS So Special?

61AS is a lab-centric class, which means there is no lecture. You learn by working through short readings and guided labs and participating in discussions. The TAs and lab assistants will guide you and help you get unstuck in lab and review the main ideas in discussions. This style of learning promotes mastery and retention -- learn by doing. [This doc] does a pretty good job of describing CS 61AS.

## Big Ideas

In 61AS, we will explore many Big Ideas that underlie all of Computer Science. Here are some of the big ones:

  * **Functions** - To start off with, we'll think of programs as functions. All programs are essentially built up of a bunch of functions. We'll start here and see what exactly is a function and what we can use them for.
  * **Data** - Data is another thing essential to programs. Making data the central focus of our programs leads to powerful results.
  * **State** - These ideas deal with the question of "How do we program assuming we can change things over time?"
  * **Interpreters** - We go into how an interpreter works, and end up writing our own. We'll also consider a few other interpreters and see what they all have in common.
  * **Programming Paradigms** - Where we blow your mind and make you program in a completely different way than you've been doing for the past 13 weeks.

## Takeaways

In this section, we learned about seven of the Big Ideas behind CS 61AS. Anything we will ever learn in this class will fall into one of these categories.
