This class is full of Big Ideas! Here are the first two:

* The purpose of this course is to **help you learn**.
* The staff are here to **help you succeed**.

If at any point you feel like this isn't the case, speak up!
The following are all effective methods for getting help:

* Speak to a staff member in lab
* Post on Piazza
* Go to a TA's office hours

## Big Ideas

In 61AS, we will explore many Big Ideas that underlie all of Computer Science. Here are some of the big ones:

* **Functions**: To start off with, we'll think of programs as combinations of functions.
We'll examine what a function is and what we can use them for.
* **Data**: Data is another thing essential to programs. Making data the central focus of our programs leads to powerful results.
* **State**: We'll then answer the question, "How do we program assuming we can change things over time?"
* **Interpreters**: We go into how an interpreter works, and we'll even write our own. We'll also consider a few other interpreters and see what they all have in common.
* **Programming Paradigms**: We explore alternate ways of thinking about programs.

## Takeaways

In this section, we learned about the Big Ideas behind CS 61AS.
Everything we'll cover in this class falls into one of these categories.
