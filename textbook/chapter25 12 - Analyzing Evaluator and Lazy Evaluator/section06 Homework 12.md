## Additional Challenging Questions

**Do this if you want to. This is NOT for credit.**

## Exercise 4.

  
Abelson & Sussman, exercise [4.31](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-
text/book/book-Z-H-27.html#%_thm_4.31). This exercise doesn't require great
brilliance, but it's a lot of work and involves a lot of debugging of details.
On the other hand, completing this exercise will teach you a lot about the
evaluator.

## Exercise 5.

  
Fix the handle-infix procedure from project 4 to handle infix precedence for
arithmetic operators properly. That is, multiplications and divisions should
be done before additions and subtractions. Comparison operators like = come
last of all.
