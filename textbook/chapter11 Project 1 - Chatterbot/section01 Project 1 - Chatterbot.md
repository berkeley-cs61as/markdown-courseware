It's time to put your skills to the test. In our lessons and homework, we've created small projects with no more than a few lines of code. Now, we're going to have you work on and write parts of a larger project, Chatterbot.

A "Chatterbot" is a program that is able to "chat" or "communicate" with a
user and simulating a conversation. We are going to implement some simple
chatterbots in this project using concepts that you learned.

To get the skeleton code for this project, type in the terminal

    
    
    	cp -r ~cs61as/lib/chatterbot/ .
    	

You should then have a directory called "chatterbot" with 4 files inside them.

  * **readme.txt** contains instructions and questions for this project.
  * **chatterbot.rkt** is the main file for Chatterbot. You will be writing ALL of your code (not including tests) here.
  * **grader.rkt** is an autograder for this project. Note that it is not comprehensive. You will write your own tests here, and they will count as part of your project grade.
  * **adjectives.rkt** contains a list of adjectives. DO NOT modify this file!

This is an individual project. You can bounce ideas with your classmate, but
sharing or copying your classmate's code (or ones you find online) will be
considered cheating. Please review our cheating policy on the syllabus if you are considering practicing academic dishonesty :). 

Before you submit, make sure that your file loads without any error. **Submissions that do not load properly will receive NO CREDIT.**

If you have any questions, please ask on Piazza, in office hours, or during lab.

Have fun!
