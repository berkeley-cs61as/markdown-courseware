## Combining Work

You've finished Part 2 of the Adventure Game! At this point, you should have finished Questions 1, 2, A3-A8, and B3-B8. Combine your answers and make sure your code still works correctly.

## Testing

Check that your transcript accurately reflects how your code works. Even if your answer is on, include a demonstration of that error into your transcript.

## What's Ahead

There is one more required question and some optional extra questions for both partners to complete. Your code MUST be combined and functional for Question 9 to be doable.
