## Submission Files

The files that you will need to submit for this project are:

  * `adv.scm`
  * `adv-world.scm`
  * `transcript`

These files should include solutions to Questions 1-9 **for both partners**. Make sure you have added comments to your code highlighting all of the changes you've made. Your answers to Question 2 can be in `adv-world.scm` or you transcript, as long as it is commented out properly.

**Make sure you clearly indicate at the top of `adv.scm` which partner is
Partner A and which is Partner B.**

## Submitting Through the Terminal

**ONLY ONE PARTNER SHOULD SUBMIT THE PROJECT.** Navigate into your `adventure` directory and type the following into your terminal:

	submit proj3

When you submit, it will prompt you for your partner's login. (If it prompts you to put another login, type `.` and press enter.)

To ensure submission went well, both partners should type
    
    glookup -t
    

to check for the submission. This command gives you a list of all submitted assignments, as well as when they were submitted.

If you need to re-submit your project for any reason, have the **same person as
before** submit the file. If this is not possible, send your reader an email as
a heads-up clarifying the situation.

## END OF PROJECT

Congrats, you're done! Go outside and ask Brian to buy you a bagel from Noah's and eat it at Sproul Hall. Wait, there's a life outside of `adv.scm`, right?
