## Resources and Computing

Computers are powerful, but they have limits. Because of this, part of a
programmer's job is to manage a computer's resources efficiently&mdash;if a
programmer writes a program that is too inefficient, the computer will run out
of resources attempting to execute it. There are two broad ways a program can
be inefficient: space and time. Space is the amount of "scratch paper" the
computer requires to carry out a program. Time is the amount of time required
before the computer finishes running a program. In the following sections, we
will examine both of these dimensions in detail.

First, we will take a look at space. An inefficient program may take up too
much space to run, leading the computer to crash. We will examine what causes
this and how we may prevent it through a specific type of recursion--tail
recursion.

Next, we will consider time. Some programs may run longer than than the
lifespan of the universe. (For example, the best programs we know to find a
perfect solution to Chess.) We will learn how to identify such programs, and
more generally, introduce and practice a method in which to measure how
time-efficient our programs are.

Lastly, we will also describe another new type of recursion--tree recursion.
Utilizing tree recursion in our programs allows us to tackle problems that we
previously didn't have the tools to solve. We will particularly focus on what
the costs and benefits this new technique brings.
