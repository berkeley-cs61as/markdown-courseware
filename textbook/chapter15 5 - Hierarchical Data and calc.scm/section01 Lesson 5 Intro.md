## Introduction

This lesson builds upon the idea of hierarchical structures&mdash;structures made
up of parts, which themselves are made up of parts, and so on. We will use
these ideas to make a simple calculator in Racket at the end of the lesson.

### Warning

This lesson is substantially more dense and time-consuming than previous lessons.
Make sure you pace yourself so as not to fall behind.

## Prerequisites and What to Expect

Material from Lesson 4 is required before working on this lesson.

We will briefly go over `cons` and `list` before extending their usage to build more
complex structures.
