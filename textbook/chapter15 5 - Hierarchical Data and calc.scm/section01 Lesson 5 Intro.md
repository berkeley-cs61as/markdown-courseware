## Introduction

This lesson builds upon the idea of hierarchical structures - structures made
up of parts, which themselves are made up of parts, and so on. We will use
these ideas to make a simple calculator in Racket at the end of the lesson.

## Prerequisites and What to Expect

Material from Lesson 4 is required before working on this lesson.

We will briefly go over `cons` and `list` and extend their usage to build a more
complex structure.
