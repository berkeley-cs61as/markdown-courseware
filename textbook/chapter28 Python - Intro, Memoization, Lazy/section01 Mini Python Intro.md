## Introduction
At this point, you should be very familiar with programming principles in Scheme and Racket. 
Time to transfer this knowledge into a new language! Enter Python. This is a bit more detailed than the intro to Python in your project 4 spec but still pretty basic. Doing one should make the other a breeze. Enjoy!

## Homework
The homework prompts are scattered throughout the lesson and are intended to be little exercises to do while you learn. Here's the [template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bx-YJoc_dDDGQjhHSnNlRDNkaTg). More details on the homework section of this lesson!

## Installation
We'll be using Python 3 (specifically 3.5) in this lesson. This is not equivalent to Python 2. You can skip the following if you have already installed Python 3. When you launch python in your terminal, the version you have installed is displayed so check there.

### Anaconda (recommended installation method)
Anaconda is a distribution of Python that packages together Python with some other useful libraries such as [NumPy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy). Anaconda also makes it much easier to install more extensions and automatically adds python to your computer’s path variable.

Please install Python 3.5 from this link: https://www.continuum.io/downloads and optionally read [this](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/py2or3.html) to get more acquainted with conda and its awesomeness.

It’s okay to obtain Python 3.5 via other methods, this is just a recommended method. If you run into any problems, consult Google and StackOverflow!
