## Template

Type the following command at the terminal to copy the template file to the current directory (note the period at the end):

## Exercise 1
  
Suppose that the following definitions have been provided.

```
(define x (cons 1 3))
(define y 2)
```

A CS 61AS student, intending to change the value of `x` to a pair with `car`
equal to `1` and `cdr` equal to `2`, types the expression `(set! (cdr x) y)`
instead of `(set-cdr! x y)` and gets an error. Explain why.

## Exercise 2
  
**a)** Provide the arguments for the two `set-cdr!` operations in the blanks below to produce the indicated effect on `list1` and `list2`. Do not create any new pairs; just rearrange the pointers to the existing ones.

	> (define list1 (list (list 'a) 'b))
	list1 

	> (define list2 (list (list 'x) 'y))
	list2 

	> (set-cdr! ________ ________)
	okay 

	> (set-cdr! ________ ________)
	okay 

	> list1
	((a x b) b) 

	> list2
	((x b) y) 

**b)** After filling in the blanks in the code above and producing the specified
effect on `list1` and `list2`, draw a box-and-pointer diagram that explains
the effect of evaluating the expression `(set-car! (cdr list1) (cadr list2))`.

## Exercise 3

  
Complete exercises [3.13 and 3.14](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-22.html#%_thm_3.13) in Abelson & Sussman.

## Exercise 4
  
Complete exercises [3.16, 3.17](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-22.html#%_thm_3.16), [3.21](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-22.html#%_thm_3.21), [3.25, and 3.27](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-22.html#%_thm_3.25) in Abelson & Sussman.

**Note:** You do not need to draw the environment diagram for exercise 3.27; use the `trace` procedure to provide the requested explanations. Treat the table procedures `lookup` and `insert!` as primitive; i.e. don't trace the procedures they call. Also, assume that those procedures work in constant time. We're interested to know about the number of times `memo-fib` is invoked.

## Exercise 5

Write `vector-append`, which takes two vectors as arguments and returns a new vector containing the elements of both arguments, analogous to `append` for lists.

**Don't use a list as an intermediate value. (That is, don't convert the vectors to lists at any time!)**

## Exercise 6

  
Write `vector-filter`, which takes a predicate function and a vector as arguments, and returns a new vector containing only those elements of the argument vector for which the predicate returns `true`. The new vector should be exactly big enough for the chosen elements. Compare the running time of your program to this version:

	(define (vector-filter pred vec)
		(list->vector (filter pred (vector->list vec))))

**Don't use a list as an intermediate value. (That is, don't convert the vectors to lists at any time!)**

## Exercise 7
  
Sorting a vector:

**a)** Write `bubble-sort!`, which takes a vector of numbers and rearranges them to be in increasing order. (You'll modify the argument vector; do not create a new one.) Use the following algorithm for your definition:
  1. Go through the array, looking at two adjacent elements at a time, starting with elements 0 and If the earlier element is larger than the later element, swap them. Then look at the next overlapping pair (0 and 1, then 1 and 2, etc.).
  2. Recursively `bubble-sort` all but the last element (which is now the largest element).
  3. Stop when you have only one element to sort.

**b)** Prove that this algorithm really does sort the vector. **Hint:** Prove the parenthetical claim in step 2.

**c)** What is the order of growth of the running time of this algorithm?

**Don't use a list as an intermediate value. (That is, don't convert the vectors to lists at any time!)**

## Extra for Experts: Exercise 8

**Do this if you want to. This is NOT for credit.**

Abelson & Sussman, exercises [3.19](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-22.html#%_thm_3.19) and [3.23](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-22.html#%_thm_3.23). 

Exercise 3.19 is especially challenging, so props to you if you solve it. You'll need to look at some of the other exercises you may have skipped in this section. Exercise 3.23 is slightly easier, but be careful about the Î˜(1) running time requirement.

## Extra for Experts: Exercise 9

**Do this if you want to. This is NOT for credit.**
  
Write the procedure `cxr-name`. Its argument will be a function made by composing `cars` and `cdrs`. It should return the appropriate name for that function:

	> (cxr-name (lambda (x) (cadr (cddar (cadar x)))))
	CADDDAADAR
