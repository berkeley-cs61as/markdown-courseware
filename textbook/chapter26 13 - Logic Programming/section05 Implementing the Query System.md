## Implementing the Query System

If you're interested in how the inner workings of this query system works, take a look at [SICP Section 4.4.4](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-29.html#%_sec_4.4.4). While this material is very interesting, **you are not responsible for knowing the implementation of the query system for this class**.
