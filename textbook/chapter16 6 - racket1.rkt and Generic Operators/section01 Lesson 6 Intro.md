## Introduction

In this lesson, we begin our exploration of **generic operators**&mdash;procedures that can be called
on different data types. The basic idea behind generic operators is that we have
different types of data that are "intelligent"&mdash;they know how to manipulate themselves.
Procedures are then allowed to be "stupid"&mdash;they don't need to know anything about data types and somehow it still works out.

We'll then introduce **Racket-1**, a simple Racket interpreter
written in Racket. While it cannot do all the things Racket can, it does
demonstrate the basic components that make up an interpreter.

## Prerequisites

You should have a good understanding of `calc.rkt` and data abstraction.
