## Alternatives to 61AS

**CS 61A** is the sister course to 61AS. It is offered in the traditional lecture-lab-discussion format, and covers the same Big Ideas as 61AS, except in the Python language and with a slightly different syllabus. 61A is the equivalent of Units 1-4 of 61AS. Taking either Units 1-4 of 61AS OR taking 61A will fulfill the requirements for CogSci, BioE, etc. Find out more about CS 61A here: [http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/).

**CS 10** is called "The Beauty and Joy of Computing". It covers the equivalent of Units 0 and 1 of 61AS, and also aims to provide a gentle intro to Computer Science. CS 10 does not fullfil any of the requirements that 61A or 61AS fulfills. It uses a graphical language called Snap! that allows you to program by dragging and dropping components together.

## So What's the Difference?

Each class has something different to offer. To see an organized comparison of CS 10, CS 61A, and CS 61AS, take a look at [this doc](https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/document/d/1zAfHaEi1aABIfJwVOFMYgnYMbNlp9-ebSJ81LI2CJaI/edit?usp=sharing).

## Takeaways

Now, hopefully you have at least a little idea of what this class is going to be about. We learned in this section about the other introductory CS courses that Berkeley has to offer.
