## Before We Begin...

Before we start Lesson 0.1, we'll have to get your lab account set up. You'll find the instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/document/d/1a5tuY3VFxnsxkzu3mI99jghNXyPb_sWhqDf3PpYAR7s/edit?usp=sharing). (If you're not currently enrolled in CS 61AS, skip to Step 11.)

Once you've finished, move on to the next section!
