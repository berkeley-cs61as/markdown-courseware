## What Is Computer Science?

There isn't any one right answer. Computer science means a lot of different
things to a lot of different people. For some, it means building [a web
application that allows you to connect and keep up with your
friends](https://joindiaspora.com/). For others, it means engineering [self-driving cars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_driverless_car). For yet
others, it means [lots and lots of
math](http://www.librow.com/articles/article-10). And [so
on](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/11/raspberry-pi-microwave-hack/).

Generally speaking, computer science answers the following
questions:

  1. What can we compute?
  2. How do we compute it?
  3. What can we do with that?

In this sense, computer science isn't about computers&mdash;that's closer to
electrical engineering&mdash;and it isn't really a science&mdash;scientists
discover, we invent.

Computer scientists are like engineers: we [build cool
stuff](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy5g33S0Gzo), and we [solve
problems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake_sorting).

## Complexity and Abstraction

All interesting problems in computer science are inherently complex&mdash;as are their solutions.

Consider your web browser, the program you're using to view this page.
Clearly, it solves an interesting problem. It's also highly complex:
when you type in a URL, your browser has to determine which
server to contact, ask that server to give it the webpage you're looking for,
download the webpage, interpret the webpage, and display it on your screen.
Each of these steps contains its own complex parts.

How does all of this fit together? In one word: abstraction!
Abstraction allows us to treat a complicated process as a single unit,
and to use that unit in an even more complex process.

We already use
abstraction in our daily lives: To drive a car, we have to know how to steer and operate
the pedals, but we don't have to know how the engine and drivechain work.
To bake an apple pie, we need a recipie and an oven,
but we need not grow our own apples or understand how they are grown.
And to use the internet, we don't have to understand the
protocols for requesting webpages&mdash;our browser abstracts that process away,
so we can browse <s>dank memes</s> websites quickly and easily.

In this course, we'll explore techniques for creating abstractions to solve problems.
