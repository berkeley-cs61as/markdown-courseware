## Introduction to Racket and CS61AS

"Welcome to CS 61AS, the world's best computer science course, because we use
the world's best CS book as the textbook. The only thing wrong with this
course is that all the rest of the CS courses for the rest of your life will
seem a little disappointing (and repetitive)."

## Prerequisites and What to Expect
