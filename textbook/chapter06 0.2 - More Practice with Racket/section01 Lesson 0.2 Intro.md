## Introduction

This lesson covers the Racket programming language in more depth, and also expands on Functional Programming, a programming paradigm that solves problems through the evaluation of functions, and one of the Big Ideas we discussed in Lesson 0-1.

## Prerequisites and What to Expect

**Prerequisites:** Make sure you have fully completed Lesson 0-1 and Homework 0-1 before starting on this Lesson.

**What to Expect:** In this lesson, we will:

  * go over the basic syntax of Racket
  * use Racket to solve simple problems
  * highlight the idea of Functional Programming

## Introduction to Racket

Racket is a dialect of Lisp, i.e.,

> "the greatest single programming language ever designed" -- Alan Kay

Why do we learn it?

> "Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days [...]" -- Eric Raymond
