## Introduction

An expression is a question you ask the computer. We ask questions in the
Scheme programming language. The computer responds by thinking a bit,
evaluating our question, and returning us an answer, called a value.

Everything in Scheme that we type in is an expression.

## Evaluation

Scheme evaluates things using the following rules:

  1. Evaluate the operator and operands
  2. Apply the operator to the operands
