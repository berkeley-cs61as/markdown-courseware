## Exercise 6.

  
[SICP Ex. 2.18](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-
text/book/book-Z-H-15.html#%_thm_2.18); this should take some thought, and you
should make sure you get it right, but don't get stuck on it for a whole hour.
Note: Your solution should reverse lists, not sentences! That is, you should
be using `cons`, `car`, and `cdr`, not `first`, `sentence`, etc.
